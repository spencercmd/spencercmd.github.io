# OSINT

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) is widely used in our community..and mostly free.

There are swathes of places to analyze and retrieve OSINT. Here are some that I use during penetration testing and studying:

OWASP Favicon DB

Wapp Analyzer

Archive.org

Google’s Encryption Transparency page

Recently, I’ve begun a relatively deep-dive into the available OSINT resources on the deep web.

I’ve been a part of the deep web community since I was a teenager. I’ve met some amazing people who have accomplished some incredible things..and have met some equally devious people who have lost their freedom.

Part of the culture within deep web communities is obfuscation, less transparency and a sort of fluidity to where communities nest. This is purposeful..obviously there is no still water in these communities. But within these communities, if you can keep up, are some incredibly valuable OSINT resources..as well as other types of resources for learning and growth!
