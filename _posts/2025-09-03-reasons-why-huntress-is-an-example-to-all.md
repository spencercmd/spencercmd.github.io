# What is Huntress

Huntress is basically a 24/7 managed SOC provider. Their client uses either the MS Defender or S1 agent as the engine. The Huntress client monitors your systems 24/7 for IoCs, drops ransomware canaries/tmp files on your system to detect encryption, monitors behavior analysis etc.

Once a threat is detected, the client reaches out to the Huntress API immediately and triggers a cascade of alerts, actions, and individual human SOC analyst review. It's great to watch in action.

Huntress has saved our butts a few times. One incident required Huntress to isolate our servers from the network. Happened at 3AM our time. Was a clusterfuck responding to the incident and figuring out where the threat actor had gained access from but, Huntress kicked em out. Defender detected a malicious C2 connection, blocked it, Huntress took care of the rest. We sleep better at night knowing all of our endpoints have Huntress installed.

# Why is Huntress the best

It starts with humans. Huntress employs real humans as SOC analysts. Real. Humans. Imagine that. I don't count faceless offshore NPCs in call centers as real humans. Within our conceivable simulation, I doubt an iota of sentience crosses those synapses. I hold nothing but contempt for the Accentures and Cognizants of the world. IYKYK.

Huntress also has a fully remote work culture. Employees have the option of working in person but, the culture employs remote first BUT, US-based. This is critical to their success. In the modern age, having the option of your work configuration is the only thing that makes sense. Any other paradigm lacking choice is total delusion by fatcats in suits with no ability to discern real productivity, and these suits are not effectively utilizing their workforce. A hocked loogie in the face of humanity.

Huntress has insane community outreach, and delivers immense value to the cybersecurity community. Sponsors events, transmits a positive message, and includes everyone. They don't get political, they don't take sides, they don't participate in identity politics, they simply want the best of the best working for them and deliver value to the customers they hold dear. That's the best part about being a Huntress customer. They give a shit about you.
